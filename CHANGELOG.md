# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added per-rule `error`, `warning`, and `off` policies via `archetype.toml`
  for gradual rule adoption and rollout control. (#64)

### Documentation
- Documented current `archetype check` flags, including `--group`,
  `--format json`, `--quiet`, and `--no-cache` examples. (#42)

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-05

### Added
- `archetype doctor` command for inspecting detected layout, package roots,
  modules, import edges, config source, excludes, cache status, layers, and
  internal packages.
- `archetype graph` command for exporting the discovered import graph as
  Mermaid or JSON.
- Unmatched pattern diagnostics for rule source, target, allowed, layer,
  boundary, cycle, and naming patterns.
- Pattern suggestions for likely misspellings when a rule pattern matches no
  modules.
- JSON report schema v2 with violation `file`, `line`, `target`, and per-rule
  `diagnostics` fields.

### Changed
- Transitive dependency violations now point to the first import statement in
  the forbidden dependency path.
- Layering violations now include the source file and line for the offending
  import.
- Circular import violations now include a source file and line instead of
  reporting `<unknown>`.
- Rules with unmatched patterns now report as warnings instead of silently
  passing.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-26

### Added
- Git pre-commit hook integration via `archetype install-hook`.
- GitHub PR inline annotations support with `--github-annotations`.
- Baseline mode for legacy repositories via `--write-baseline` and `--baseline`.
- Project config defaults through `archetype.toml`.
- Exclude paths support via CLI (`--exclude`) and config.
- Versioned JSON contract with explicit `schema_version`.
- Namespace package and monorepo layout support improvements.
- Changed-files mode with `--changed-from <git-ref>`.

### Changed
- CI/release workflows expanded to cover new check and packaging behaviors.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-09

### Added
- Introduced static import graph analysis that maps module dependencies without executing application code.
- Added a rule authoring model using `@rule` decorators and a central registry so architectural checks are defined as plain Python.
- Shipped a readable query DSL with project loading, import constraints, and cycle checks for writing architecture policies.
- Added a CLI command (`archetype check`) that discovers `architecture.py`, executes rules, and returns CI-friendly exit codes.
- Added a pytest plugin that auto-collects `architecture.py` rules as native pytest test items with readable failure output.
- Added a shared reporting layer for consistent violation formatting across CLI and pytest execution paths.
- Added built-in rule packs for layering constraints, module boundaries, naming conventions, and circular import detection.
- Added test fixtures and comprehensive pytest coverage for graph construction, DSL behavior, CLI behavior, plugin collection, and built-in rules.
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for reusable architecture checks in downstream projects and matrix CI for Archetype development.
- Added packaging and release automation for PyPI publication using GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing.
